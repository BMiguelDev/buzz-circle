# Buzz Circle App

#### This is a social blog app. It allows the user to create and manage posts, and view all authors and their respective posts. It also has an authentication system that protects the app's resources from being changed by an unauthorized user. It was developed alongside a REST API in the backend that allows performing CRUD operations to these resources, which are stored in a MongoDB database.

#### Developed using React, Typescript, Redux and Styled Components
